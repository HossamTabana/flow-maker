The app is a Next.js-based visual agent builder.

## Key Technologies
- Next.js and TypeScript
- UI: shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, React Flow (@xyflow/react)
- State: React state, persisted to localStorage
- Core: LlamaIndex for agent/workflow logic

## Structure
- `app/`: Main layout, routing, and API.
  - `page.tsx`: Entry point with a tabbed interface for Edit, Compile, and Run views.
  - `api/`: Backend routes, proxying to a LlamaCloud service.
- `src/`: Core components.
  - `components/`: UI components for the different views.
    - `AgentFlow.tsx`: The "Edit" view for building the agent.
    - `CompileView.tsx`: The "Compile" view.
    - `RunView.tsx`: The "Run" view.
    - `nodes/`: Different node types for the agent graph.

## Workflow
1.  **Edit**: Build agent by adding and connecting nodes in `AgentFlow`.
2.  **Compile**: `CompileView` transforms the visual graph into an executable format.
3.  **Run**: `RunView` executes the compiled agent, interacting with the LlamaCloud API.
